# Mutual-Fund-Recommender-System

This repository contains a Mutual Fund Recommender System built using Jupyter Notebooks. The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Client Profile Creation**
2. **Associative Rule Mining**
3. **Recommender System**

## Introduction

The Mutual Fund Recommender System aims to provide personalized mutual fund recommendations to clients based on their profiles and transaction history. The system uses various algorithms and techniques to create client profiles, mine frequent patterns, and generate recommendations.

## Usage

- `1. client_profiling.ipynb`: This notebook creates client profiles based on their attributes and requirements.
- `2. association_rule_mining.ipynb`: This notebook performs associative rule mining using different algorithms and compares them to mine frequent patterns from the transaction data of clients and mutual funds.
- `3. fund_fund_collab_filtering.ipynb`: This notebook builds the recommender system using different collaborative filtering techniques and compares them to get the best recommendations for funds.
